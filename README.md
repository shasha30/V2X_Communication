# V2XCommunication_withEdgeComputing5G_andBeyond

The rise of connected vehicles has led to massive data generation and increased computational demands. Initially, cloud computing was utilized to handle these requirements; however, it suffers from high latency, making it less suitable for time-sensitive applications. V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) applications require ultra-low latency to support real-time performance and millisecond-level decision-making. To meet these requirements, edge computing emerges as a promising solution by bringing computation closer to the user equipment (UE). Specifically, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) reduces latency by processing data at the network edge. When MEC is applied in vehicular networks, it is referred to as Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC). VEC not only ensures low-latency processing but also enables advanced capabilities such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) task offloading, Roadside Unit (RSU)-based computing, and proximity-based resource sharing among vehicles
